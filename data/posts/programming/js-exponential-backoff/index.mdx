## TL;DR

- Transient Failures do happen, for which we can retry with a limit
- Retry increases load on already overloaded servers
- Retry by adding a delay that increases exponentially, will reduce the load.

## Sample Scenario

- You have an UI, which shows some data.
- The data is fetched at client side via some API
- The server serving the request is overloaded or some throttling is implemented, hence the server is rejecting new calls.
- Making the api call again may succeed.
- So this application needs to add retries.
- But then, if we add retry, would it not add load on an already overloaded system, increasing the failure rates?

## Strategy 1 - Simple Retry

- We want the users to see the data ASAP
- So we will retry ASAP

<Code code={simpleRetryCode} lang='ts' />

### Problem with Immediate Retry

- The server on load will increase drastically, You would be calling this `1000/response-time-in-ms`
- Eg: For an API with response time of 50ms, it would now make 20 calls per second.
- So we should probably add some waiting time before the next call

### Strategy 2: Retry with constant wait

<Code code={simpleRetryWithDelayCode} lang='ts' />

### Strategy 3: Retry with exponential Wait

<Code code={simpleRetryWithExponentialDelayCode} lang='ts' />

### Final Code: Abortable Retry with Exponential Back-off

The Functions should be abortable in production code.
