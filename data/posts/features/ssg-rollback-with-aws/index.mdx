## The Problem

SSG Generates all the pages at build time, and hence with increasing pages, the build time increases.
During an incident, re-generating the entire site after a fix will take time. Since the SSG has all the static content already, rolling back to a previous build is often better while you resolve the incident.

## Solution

### Keep the previous builds

In your S3 bucket, while pushing the changes for a new build, instead of replacing the old files, we can just push into a new directory with buildNumber.

```ascii title="S3 Bucket Folder Structure"
S3 Bucket
├── build_001
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── ...
├── build_002
│   ├── ...
├── build_003
│   ├── ...
└── build_004
    ├── ...
```

### Configure a custom origin header in CF

Add a header in CDN's origin configuration. This is always updated with the new release post syncing all the files to S3

To add `buildVersion`, navigate to the CF distribution and Select Origins -> Select Origin -> Edit -> Origin Custom Headers

import buildVersionScreenshot from './add-build-version.jpg'

<Image src={buildVersionScreenshot} alt='Add Build Version' class='w-full' />

### Make a given version live (forward / rollback)

<Code code={versionDeploymentCode} title='version-deployment.sh' lang='bash' />

### Use lambda@edge to add prefix in request URI

The lambda@edge will receive this buildNumber header, which it can use to prefix the request URI and hence serving the right file
