## Mircofrontends

Microfrontends are an architectural approach for building web applications where the front-end is divided into smaller, independent, and self-contained modules or "microapps." These microapps can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, similar to the microservices architecture on the backend.

## Microsites

A microsite is a small, specialized website that typically focuses on a specific topic, campaign, or product rather than serving as a comprehensive platform for an entire organization. Microsites are designed to provide targeted information, engage a particular audience, or achieve a specific goal.
